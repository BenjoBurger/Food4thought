Apollo 11 

Motivation 

Do you ever find yourself bored of making the same dishes over and over again? After all, there are limitless combinations of exciting and novel recipes you could whip up instead of that egg fried rice for the 5th time this week. However, you may not always have time to run to the grocery store to prepare all the necessary ingredients, only to never use that one specific sauce or vegetable again. 

Why isnâ€™t there an app that could source the internet new and interesting dishes you could prepare only with the ingredients that you have? Even better, why not share your dish recipes with your friends or our community?


Aim 

We would like our users to be able to fully utilise any ingredients they have in their kitchen to create a new dish and to be able to try different dishes everyday. Additionally, we would like to cultivate a community of people who are passionate about cooking.
